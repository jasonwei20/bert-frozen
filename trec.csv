/Users/jasonwei/opt/anaconda3/envs/nlp/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/utils/deprecation.py:143: FutureWarning: The sklearn.utils.testing module is  deprecated in version 0.22 and will be removed in version 0.24. The corresponding classes / functions should instead be imported from sklearn.utils. Anything that cannot be imported from sklearn.utils is now part of the private API.
